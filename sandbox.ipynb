      "killer t cells are a sub - group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses ( and other pathogens ) , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional . as with b cells , each type of t cell recognizes a different antigen . killer t cells are activated when their t cell receptor ( tcr ) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell . recognition of this mhc : antigen complex is aided by a co - receptor on the t cell , called cd8 . the t cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the mhc i receptors bear this antigen . when an activated t cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell ' s plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter . the entry of another toxin called granulysin ( a protease ) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis . t cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses . t cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong mhc / antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by \" helper \" t cells ( see below ) .\n",

      "the \" freedom to provide services \" under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services \" for remuneration \" , especially commercial or professional activity . for example , in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice . the court of justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified : having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice . the court of justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not . health care generally counts as a service . in geraets - smits v stichting ziekenfonds mrs geraets - smits claimed she should be reimbursed by dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in germany . the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom ( of the german health clinic ) to provide services . several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , and should not fall within article 56 . but the court of justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government ( rather than the service recipient ) paid for the service . national authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay , and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary . the court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , and this is also true in the context of the uk ' s national health service . aside from public services , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal . josemans v burgemeester van maastricht held that the netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists ( but not dutch nationals ) going to coffee shops , fell outside article 56 altogether . the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction . if an activity does fall within article 56 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the court of justice . in alpine investments bv v minister van financiën a business that sold commodities futures ( with merrill lynch and another banking firms ) attempted to challenge a dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers . the court of justice held the dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence in the dutch markets . in omega spielhallen gmbh v bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the bonn council . it bought fake laser gun services from a uk firm called pulsar ltd , but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment . the court of justice held that the german constitutional value of human dignity , which underpinned the ban , did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services . in liga portuguesa de futebol v santa casa da misericórdia de lisboa the court of justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent . the ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet . in the services directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed .\n",

      "during the mass high school education movement from 1910 – 1940 , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor . high school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work . in fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping - stone to acquire college and advanced degrees . this decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers . education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy . lagerlof and galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap . it is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries .\n",

      "dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic . galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an \" absolute rest frame \" did not exist . galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest . this was contrary to aristotle ' s notion of a \" natural state \" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached . simple experiments showed that galileo ' s understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct . for example , if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow ' s nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity , aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it . thus , in an aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship . however , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it . since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls , the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls . thus , no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity .\n",

      "the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ( \" little tentacles \" ) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . the tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it . colloblasts are specialized mushroom - shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . the function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart . in addition to colloblasts , members of the genus haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria - eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense . the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ( in 40 to 60 milliseconds ) ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey . the unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle . the wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type . coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle .\n",

' contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism . : 116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus .

      "trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale . when rich countries trade with poor countries , the low - skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , while low - skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages . trade economist paul krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the united states . he attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . however , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in america is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . empirical economists max roser and jesus crespo - cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . they empirically confirm the predictions of the stolper – samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes . lawrence katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5 - 15 % of rising income inequality . robert lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low - skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low - skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries .\n",

      "the term \" imperialism \" is often conflated with \" colonialism \" , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition . imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one ' s superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people . robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions . colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power . particularly , edward said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating ; \" imperialism involved ' the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory ' , while colonialism refers to the ' implanting of settlements on a distant territory . ' contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism . : 116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus .

      "philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force . in part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non - obvious force of friction , and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion . a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity . most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by galileo galilei and sir isaac newton . with his mathematical insight , sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved - on for nearly three hundred years . by the early 20th century , einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia .\n",

[ . . . ] for reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . \" however , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \" strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it \" , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . contemporary lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in luther . luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . bernhard lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work \" fides und ratio \" that luther ultimately sought to put the two together . more recently , hans - peter grosshans has demonstrated that luther ' s work on biblical criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . this means that for luther it is more important that the bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . the right tool for understanding the world outside of the bible for luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . here a different picture is presented of a luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . luther ' s concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .\n",

      "the \" freedom to provide services \" under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services \" for remuneration \" , especially commercial or professional activity . for example , in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice . the court of justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified : having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice . the court of justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not . health care generally counts as a service . in geraets - smits v stichting ziekenfonds mrs geraets - smits claimed she should be reimbursed by dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in germany . the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom ( of the german health clinic ) to provide services . several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , and should not fall within article 56 . but the court of justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government ( rather than the service recipient ) paid for the service . national authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay , and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary . the court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , and this is also true in the context of the uk ' s national health service . aside from public services , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal . josemans v burgemeester van maastricht held that the netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists ( but not dutch nationals ) going to coffee shops , fell outside article 56 altogether . the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction . if an activity does fall within article 56 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the court of justice . in alpine investments bv v minister van financiën a business that sold commodities futures ( with merrill lynch and another banking firms ) attempted to challenge a dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers . the court of justice held the dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence in the dutch markets . in omega spielhallen gmbh v bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the bonn council . it bought fake laser gun services from a uk firm called pulsar ltd , but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment . the court of justice held that the german constitutional value of human dignity , which underpinned the ban , did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services . in liga portuguesa de futebol v santa casa da misericórdia de lisboa the court of justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent . the ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet . in the services directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed .\n",

[ . . . ] for reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . \" however , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason \" strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it \" , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . contemporary lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in luther . luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . bernhard lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work \" fides und ratio \" that luther ultimately sought to put the two together . more recently , hans - peter grosshans has demonstrated that luther ' s work on biblical criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . this means that for luther it is more important that the bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . the right tool for understanding the world outside of the bible for luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . here a different picture is presented of a luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . luther ' s concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .\n",

      "the most widely accepted estimate for the middle east , including iraq , iran and syria , during this time , is for a death rate of about a third . the black death killed about 40 % of egypt ' s population . half of paris ' s population of 100 , 000 people died . in italy , the population of florence was reduced from 110 – 120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351 . at least 60 % of the population of hamburg and bremen perished , and a similar percentage of londoners may have died from the disease as well . interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in central london found well - preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre - planning and christian burials at this time . before 1350 , there were about 170 , 000 settlements in germany , and this was reduced by nearly 40 , 000 by 1450 . in 1348 , the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins , about a third of the european population had already perished . in crowded cities , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 % of the population to die . the disease bypassed some areas , and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion . monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the black death .\n",
