what are environmentalists concerned about having released from the amazon region ?
--
environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest , and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation , which could accelerate global warming . amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10 % of the world ' s terrestrial primary productivity and 10 % of the carbon stores in ecosystems — of the order of 1 . 1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon . amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0 . 62 ± 0 . 37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996 .

#correctely matches "concerned about", but not strong enough match for "release". does not encode "and also"? I would expect syntax parsing to be good here...

in what type of molecules are oxygen found ?
--
the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to ( or generated by ) life . only a few common complex biomolecules , such as squalene and the carotenes , contain no oxygen . of the organic compounds with biological relevance , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen . all fats , fatty acids , amino acids , and proteins contain oxygen ( due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues ) . oxygen also occurs in phosphate ( po3 − 
 4 ) groups in the biologically important energy - carrying molecules atp and adp , in the backbone and the purines ( except adenine ) and pyrimidines of rna and dna , and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite .

what types of responsibilities might a pharmacy technician have ?
--
a pharmacy technician in the uk is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist ( if employed in a hospital pharmacy ) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians . in the uk the role of a pht has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research . a pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the general pharmaceutical council ( gphc ) register . the gphc is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians .

what type of person can not be attributed civil disobedience ?

civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen ' s relation to the state and its laws , as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies , especially two equally sovereign branches of government , conflict . for instance , if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country ' s highest court , it would not be civil disobedience , since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen .

what has the lower rainfall in the amazon during the lgm been attributed to ?
--
there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21 , 000 years through the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) and subsequent deglaciation . analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin . there is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was . some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .
